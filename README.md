# EDM Lab Tasks

This repository contains my lab task completion for the EDM (Electronic Data Management) course. In this lab, I learned how to perform raw data cleansing and store the cleaned data on GitHub. 

Data cleansing is an essential process in data analysis that involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in raw data, such as missing values, duplicates, or incorrect formatting. Mastering this skill ensures the quality and reliability of data used for analysis.

## About Me

**Name:** Aron John Dizon

I am passionate about music and its ability to connect people. I’ve always been drawn to the creative side of music production and have spent time learning about sound engineering. Outside of my studies, I enjoy experimenting with different musical styles and creating my own beats.

I believe music is a universal language, and I’m excited to continue developing my skills in this field.
